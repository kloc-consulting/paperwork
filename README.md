# paperwork
Paperwork is an extremely simple note database based on php and PostgreSQL. 
Paperwork can only be used in private, single-user networks. It does not have any user management or protection. 
On the other side, it is an extremely useful, simple, straight-forward note management system. If you have already an private Apache server and PostgreSQL server in your network you can easily install Paperwork.

## Installation
Installation is simple: 
- download the files, 
- copy it to your file system such that Apache can find then, 
- setup PostgreSQL using the files in the SQL directory 
- edit the pwork.ini file in the config directory
- try and have fun!

## Using Paperwork
There are only two pages: one for searching notes and one for editing.
